        <br>Font used is Sans Decorif designed by Jaxine Wong.</h4>
     <pre>
     The design for this book was based on the type, which I created using 
     Fontstruct. The use of two lines in a stroke and the abscence of diagonals 
     made the font feel futuristic and reminded me of Art Deco. Hence I decided
     to create a book cover that showcased the type, while having giving off
     the impression of Art Deco. The use of gold and ornaments made the cover
     feel more luxiorious and rich. Elements that were popular in Art Deco.</pre>

     <pre>
     After visiting the Most Beautiful Swiss Books exhibit, I decided to center 
     my book content on the books that were unconventional and different from 
     conventional books. Using six books, I found that I could seperate them 
     into three categories based on how unconventionality was used in the book. 
     Seperating two of the six books into the categories of unpredictability, 
     embodiment, and representation. </pre>

     <h6 id="conceptualsenses">Conceptual Senses</h6><h4>Created in the Spring of 2023 for Publishing tools for Design.</h4>
     <pre>
     To start this book I first listed off various examples of our senses in action.
     Things we hear, smell, and touch. From there I then created various different 
     compositions only using lines. Taking the list of senses and my compositions, I
     combined them to create three spreads, one for each sense. To add to the spreads
     I then added windows to them. When thinking about the overall layout of the 
     spread, I looked to conveying the way the sense worked as an image. In other
     words how sound looks as it moves through space or how touch can be translated
     through images and still be tactile. </pre>

     <pre>
     When designing this book I first started with choosing five different typefaces.
     Two that were sans serif and two serif with one being a choice of my own. I then
     took those typefaces and made them readable, using Chat GPT to generate filler
     text. From there I created five spreads wit different layouts that only comprised
     of squares and rectangles and in grayscale. Similar to Conceptual Senses, I 
     combined my text with my compositions. Only this time I played around with the
     type. Tracking it out and in, changing the leading, the size, weight, and opacity.
     Creating a book of type that is both readable and visual. </pre>

     <h6 id="goblet">The Crystal Goblet A Collection of Essays on Typography and Design</h6><h4>Created in the Spring of 2023 for Publishing tools for Design.</h4>
     <pre>
     This book is based on the three essays written by Beatrice Warde, Gunnar Swanson,
     and Jeffrey Keedy on typography. After reading and making notes on the three 
     essays I decided on the format and size of my book. I then created illustrations 
     that I would use in my book. Choosing to take the ideas of type and design of the 
     three authors and interpreting them into famous chairs and book covers. With a 
     focus on type and the idea of its readability, I decided to take some inspiration 
     from my Abstraction of Type book. As I altered the properties of my text to effect 
     the readability, changing it from text to imagery.

     <pre>
     Before making this book I learned about the golden ratio and how it was used 
     throughout many pieces. This book served as a guide to the golden ratio and 
     fibbonacci sequence as it talked about how to make them. For this cover I made
     created a illustration using the golden ratio. As I was inspired by the fact that
     the golden ratio can be found throughout the natural world. I also, wanted to 
     create a cover that was similar to how the ratio was used in old art. That you
     didn't actually see it at a first glance of the piece. </pre>

     <h6 id="photobook">Takehito Miyatake Photo Book </h6><h4> Created in Fall of 2022 for Digital Tools for Design.</h4>
     <pre>
     The purpose of this book was to work with a grid and be able to use it throughout
     the book. However, only images would be used on the spreads. I decided to feature
     images taken by Takehito Miyatake, who takes photos of nature. With only five spreads
     to work with and not wanting to just take photos and place them wherever they fit. I
     wanted to create a story or cohesivness to the book. Since many of his photos were 
     of volcanoes and green landscapes, I thought I could create a story of life and death.
     Starting with the night of a forest with tons of fireflies making the forest feel alive
     The eruption of volcanoes disrupt this lfie and bring destruction and death. After
     death has come new life is created and grows over the past. </pre>

     <pre>
     The contents of this book came from six three short line poems. When deciding on what
     poems I wanted to include I was thinking about the illustartions and imagery I would 
     create for these poems. This helped as I took characters and objects within the poems 
     and were able to create a cohesive scenery for the overall book, which was used on the 
     title page. This helped tie the entire book together as I used the same illustrations 
     throughout the book and because the imagery was taken from the poems, it related what 
     the text was and the look of the book.  </pre>

     <pre>
     This book was created as fun way for five to seven year olds to learn about taste.
     Wanting to get kids away from the screens, but still preserve the fun leearning 
     experience they can get, I created an interactive book. This book is magnetic,
     providing magnetic food that kids can use to match the taste catergory that the 
     given character is asking for. I found this to be a fun and different way to
     teach kids all about taste.  </pre>

     Before I started getting into the content of my book, I first decided to figure out the 
     size of my book. Taking two copy papers and cutting them to a size that physically felt good 
     to me for my book. Due to this book being based on three essays written by designers, I read 
     all three essays to better understand the content and find inspiration. After marking up the 
     text I simultaneously started working on the type layput and various illustrations for my book.
     Once satisfied with the overall design of my book, I started to create thumbnail mockups and 
     full scale bound version of my book. Which was used to correct any type layout and design, 
     as books looks different printed than on a computer. Once I fixed any mistakes and adjusted my 
     type I started making the book. If you look at the last photo you'll see the signatures of the 
     book. My book was small with only four signatures two being the endsheets and the other my 
     pages. To make this book I used a moleskin binding wich allows me to sew the endsheets and 
     cover boards directly to the book and wrap the cover with a print of my cover design.</pre>
